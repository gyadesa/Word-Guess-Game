In this assignment, created one of the two possible computer games chlenges: Word Guess or Psychic. The apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

Word-Guess is Essentially a classic game of "hangman" with a theme of your choice. In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!
